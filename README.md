# Immanuel Mboowa

Welcome to this blender-tropical-temperate work I have done from all the tutorials Blender Guru taught me. This repository contains the bananas and apples that I made, which exhibits progress in blender.

# Note
You won't see the full animation though in the blender file because I rendered in bits in order to check for errors and faster production.
